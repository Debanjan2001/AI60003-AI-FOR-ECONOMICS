Topic: Stock Market Prediction and Analysis using AI methods

Problem: One important problem in the area of economics is to analyze the risk factors involving in investing in stocks of various companies. To do so, we need to visualize different parameters such as the average price of various stocks, daily, ups and downs and making prediction of future behaviour. 

Solution: First of all, my dataset target would be the related to the top companies whose stock market performance is going great(such as FAANG companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google etc). I would like to use AI based algorithms such as Time series forecasting for analyzing the past data of stocks of some of these companies. Then, I will try to analyze different factors such as the moving average of the stock prices, the correlation between different stock prices and try to see and predict or forecast the trend of the probable prices of the stocks in future using AI algorithms such as LSTM(a recurrent neural network which used time-series data to predict future values) and predict and analyse whether it could be beneficial to invest in that stock and various risk factors in different stocks.
